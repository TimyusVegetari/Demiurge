Demiurge
========

This is a development project about a sandbox video game called "Demiurge".
This video game is inspired by many games like Minecraft, Diablo, Civilization, etc... It have its own universe, its own history, its own indentity. I wish to realize a game which will fill most part of the desires which I was able to have in the course of my player experiences. And I hope I will join by other people in this project to drive it to the success.

My name is Anthony Acroute but call me Timyus :)
I am a french independent developer among other things. In life, I develop this video game, play creative video games, sometimes make videos on YouTube, inform me aboutany sorts of things, militate for the animal rights, ecology, and other causes.
